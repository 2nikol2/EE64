EE64 Red Flamingo presents current projects.

[ EE64 ] - is the algorithm.  
  EE64 allows to view play of chess in full animation. 
  EE64 wants to entertain you beautiful game, played by masters. 
  EE64 design and graphic is very expressive, elegant and powerful.
  EE64 would present memorable chess matches, each developed as a separate app. 
  EE64 is probably the best-looking and the smallest chess emulator you can find on market.
       All logic and moves are in single executable.
       And just like favorite movie... you can play it again and again.
       
[ GOFORIT - G9_DIXI_GO ] - is the algorithm.                         
  GOFORIT is the motor, to manage portfolio of various assets.
  GOFORIT at it heart has the gear to carry computation of option prices by Black–Scholes model.
  GOFORIT maintains persistence of portfolio in a form of a local plain text file.
  GOFORIT user interface is simple, the same time powerful enough to carry all activities.
  GOFORIT design isn't overloaded with complexity, expressive and elegant.
       [ Note. To fully utilize results, familiarity with the model required. ]


[P.S.] - About EE64 Red Flamingo code practices.

EE64 Red Flamingo creates regular stand alone Windows applications.
All developed in C++ with supreme algorithm design, very professional choice of all data structures and API... etc.  
All algorithms, despite being functional, consume very little computer's resource including size of executable ~ 60KB.
