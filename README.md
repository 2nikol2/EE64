[1] - GoEE64Go is the algorithm.
          GoEE64Go is the chess animator.
          GoEE64Go at heart has logic to analyze, entertain and train.
          GoEE64Go - design and graphic very expressive, elegant and powerful.
          GoEE64Go - probably the best-looking, well-done, stand-alone animator you can find on market.
          GoEE64Go - just like favorite movie - you want to see it again and again.

          [ Note - App is keyboard oriented ]

[2] - GoGreenGo is the algorithm.                
          GoGreenGo is the engine, to manage portfolio of various assets.
          GoGreenGo at it heart has the gear to carry computation of option prices by Blackâ€“Scholes model.
          GoGreenGo maintains persistence of portfolio in a form of a local plain text file.
          GoGreenGo user interface is simple, the same time powerful enough to carry all activities.
          GoGreenGo design isn't overloaded with complexity, expressive and elegant.

          [ Note - To fully utilize results, familiarity with the Black-Scholes model required ]
          [ Note - App is keyboard oriented, mouse as a proxy ] 

[3] - GoForeX is the algorithm.  
          GoForeX is the engine to manage the process of buying - selling currency pair (USD/EUR) ... (EUR/GBP).
          GoForeX at heart has the gear to manage huge amounts of data flown through.
          GoForeX is greedy in a sense of trying to reach absolute max profit by numerous (permutation - iteration) as data mining.
          GoForeX is also good at analyzing, entertaining and training.
          GoForeX user interface is simple, the same time powerful enough to carry all activities.
          GoForeX design is expressive and elegant.

          [ Note - To fully utilize results, some familiarity with FX Market required ]
          [ Note - App uses FXRates publicly available on Web ]
          [                Latency of data depends on what delay each provider sets (~ 10 min )]
          [                i.e. - the best approach - use app as a Playground (Sandbox) - sharpen your brain - be better trader in real world ]

[ P.S. ]
Red Flamingo creates regular, well - done, very small in size and totally stand - alone Windows applications.
All done in C++ with supreme algorithm design, very professional choice of data structures and API... etc.  
Algorithms, despite being practical, with plenty of interesting features - [ GREEN ] - consume very little computer resource.
