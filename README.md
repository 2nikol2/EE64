It's developed in C++ with supreme algorithm design, very professional choice of all data structures and API... etc.
All logic and moves are in single executable. 
Despite being very functional, G21 is probably the smallest chess emulator you can find on market( G21.exe ~ 66KB ).
As the bottom line - it consumes very little computer's resource(CPU ~ 1% & RAM ~ 9MB).

# EE64(SCR)

EE64 is a regular Windows Screen Saver.  
It's simulates, animates moves of all 21th games of World Chess Championship 1972 between Fischer-Spassky, Match of the Century.

Microsoft Windows supports special applications called screensaver - a computer program that start automatically when the mouse and keyboard have been idle
for a specified period of time.  
When compiling the list of available screen savers, Windows searches the Startup directory for files with the "SCR" extension, usually C:\Windows\system32 
or C:\Windows\SysWOW64.  
Consult Windows doc how to Install New Screen Saver and activate it in Screen Saver Settings window on your computer.

User instruction

EE64 can be run in two modes.

1 - Manually - double clicking on it, screen savers are standard Windows executable.   Pay attention - because it's screensaver, it will be terminated at         once on first mouse's movement or use of keyboard.

2 - Auto mode - as regular classic screensaver on Windows.   Consult Windows doc how to Install New Screen Saver and activate it in Screen Saver Settings         window on your computer.
