      GOFORIT user interface is simple, the same time powerful enough to carry all activities.
      GOFORIT design isn't overloaded with complexity, expressive and elegant.
      [ Note - To fully utilize results, familiarity with the model required. ]
      

[ P.S. ]

Red Flamingo creates regular, well - done, stand - alone Windows applications.
All done in C++ with supreme algorithm design, very professional choice of data structures and API... etc.  
Algorithms, despite being practical, with plenty of interesting features - [ GREENs ] - consume very little computer's resource.
