[ P.S. ]
Red Flamingo creates regular, well - done, very small in size and totally stand - alone Windows applications.
All done in C++ with supreme algorithm design, very professional choice of data structures and API... etc.  
Algorithms, despite being practical, with plenty of interesting features - [ GREEN ] - consume very little computer resource.
