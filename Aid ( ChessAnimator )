         - [ Warning 1 ] - No { Gs } to launch ?! 
                                  - [ Fix ] - [ Refuel Gs  - F2 ] - on WELCOME screen 
         - [ Warning 2 ] - Algorithm noticed probable PGN violation 
                                     ( i.e. - game / file wasn't compose by PGN standard )
                                   - [ Fix ] - [ Delete ] - game - and - continue with the rest
                                   - In case - [ Warning 2 ] - persistent
                                     ( i.e. - many - all games in ( *.PGN )  file - corrupt )
                                     Usually, this kind of error related to - ( copy - paste ) from pre - standard source...
                                     to compose new ( *.PGN ) file
                                   - [ Fix ] - very simple... disregard current and open new ( *.PGN ) file
                                     
                                     Gramophones can't be blamed for bad sound if the record is scratched...
