GoGreenGo is the algorithm.                
GoGreenGo is the engine, to manage portfolio of various assets.
GoGreenGo at it heart has the gear to carry computation of option prices by Blackâ€“Scholes model.
GoGreenGo maintains persistence of portfolio in a form of a local plain text file.
GoGreenGo user interface is simple, the same time powerful enough to carry all activities.
GoGreenGo design isn't overloaded with complexity, expressive and elegant.

[ Note - To fully utilize results, familiarity with the Black-Scholes model required ]
[ Note - App is keyboard oriented, mouse as a proxy ]
