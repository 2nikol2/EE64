OptionPricer is the algorithm - to compute of option prices by Black–Scholes model.                
OptionPricer at heart has the engine, to manage portfolio of various assets.
OptionPricer maintains persistence of portfolio in the form of an encrypted local text file.
OptionPricer user interface is simple, but powerful enough to carry all activities.
